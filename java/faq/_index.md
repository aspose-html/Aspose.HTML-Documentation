**Q: How to convert HTML document to PDF?**

**A:** It is very simple. You can do this literally with a single line of code! 

{{< highlight java >}}

 com.aspose.html.converters.Converter.convertHTML(
        "document.html", 
        new com.aspose.html.saving.PdfSaveOptions(), 
        "output.pdf"
 );

{{< /highlight >}}

For more examples, please visit [Converting Between Formats](/html/java/converting-between-formats/) guides.

**Q: What formats does Aspose.HTML support?**

**A:** Out-of-the-box we support (X)HTML, SVG, EPub, MHTML and Markdown documents. As a part of mentioned documents we also support CSS, JavaScript, XPath and HTML5 Canvas specifications. For more details, please visit [Features List](/html/java/features-list/) page.


**Q: Can I use HTMLDocument to load EPub file format?**

**A:** In order to load EPUB, MHTML, SVG or other supported formats, we prepared specialized end-points and described it in the [Create Document](/html/java/creating-a-document/) guide. The HTMLDocument class is designed only to work with HTML files.


**Q: Can I use Aspose.HTML to extract information from a document?**

**A:** Sure, we have a powerful API to inspect the content of HTML documents. It is described in [Web Scraping](/html/java/web-scraping/) article.


**Q: Do you support XPath syntax?**

**A:** Yes.

Moreover, we support CSS Selectors and the native navigation mechanism that is called Document/Element Traversal. You can find the usage examples [here](/html/java/web-scraping/#webscraping-xpath).


**Q: Is it possible to save a few HTML documents at once?**

**A:** Yes, if you have HTML files which are linked to each other, you can use [MaxHandlingDepth](/html/java/saving-a-document/) parameter to save them as a set of files.


**Q: Is it possible to disable JavaScript for a Document?**

**A:** Yes. You should use [**sandboxing flags**](/html/java/environment-configuration/) to disable potentially untrusted resources.


**Q: How to use the MemoryStream object to store the rendering result instead of the file system?**

**A:** You can implement *Aspose.Html.IO.ICreateStreamProvider* interface to handle the output streams, as it’s described [here](/html/java/output-streams/).


**Q: How to check the list of resources that are loaded along with an HTML document?**

**A:** We have a specialized [Network Service](/html/java/environment-configuration/) that gives you full control over the all request/response messages. You can use it to trace the requests, create a custom cache, substitute the content of response messages and much more.


**Q: How to override the document style?**

**A:** There is a ‘[User Style Sheet](/html/java/environment-configuration/)’ property that can be useful exactly for this purpose.


**Q: My document does not parse properly, I see black-squares instead of letters! How can I fix it?**

**A:** We parse a document headers to detect the character-set (encoding) of the document. If the encoding is not defined we use UTF-8, which is defined as a default for HTML5 specification. If you know that encoding is different from the default UTF-8, please specify it directly as it described [here](/html/java/environment-configuration/).


**Q: I want to see page numbers at the bottom of the document, how to do this?**

**A:** Since CSS is used to describe the visual layout of the document, we designed specialized [CSS Extensions](/html/java/css-extensions/) that can be used to write information on page margins.

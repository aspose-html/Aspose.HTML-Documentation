## **HTML Colors**

Colors play an essential role in forming the perceived value of web content and the emotions a person experiences when viewing it. HTML colors are the colors used to display web pages on the web. They are closely linked to the methods of describing and defining these colors using their respective color codes. For example, HTML colors may be specified as the common English color names, or with hexadecimal values, RGB triplets, HSL, RGBA, and HSLA values. 

 In HTML and XHTML, colors can be used for text, background, frame borders, tables, and individual table cells.

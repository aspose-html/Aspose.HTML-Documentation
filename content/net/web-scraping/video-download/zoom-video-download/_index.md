## **Get Zoom Video Info**

Getting information about Zoom video file using Aspose.HTML API, the following steps should be done:

1. Initialize an instance of the [MultimediaScraper](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimediascraper) class.
2. Create a multimedia object that collects information from the specified  URL.
3. Create a [VideoInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/videoinfo) object and check whether it is an instance of the [ZoomVideoInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping.zoom/zoomvideoinfo) class.
4. Get information about the video and display it in the console.

The following code snippet can be used to get information about a video file such as Title, Description, Duration, Thumbnails, and Formats Count.
{{< highlight java >}}
using Aspose.Html.DataScraping.MultimediaScraping;
using Aspose.Html.DataScraping.MultimediaScraping.Zoom;
...

	// Initialize an instance of the MultimediaScraper class 
	using var scraper = new MultimediaScraper();
	
	// Create a multimedia object that collects information from a URL
	using var multimedia = scraper.GetMultimedia("https://zoom.us/recording/play/IMjKs3RC8-QaTcYQSFutPxB6CyrezT9pIqfsVj4nF8UIbyXbsvzMnLgjgP83cDHS");              
	
	// Get a VideoInfo object and check whether it is an instance of ZoomVideoInfo class 
	var videoInfo = multimedia.CollectVideoInfo();
	
	if (videoInfo is ZoomVideoInfo)
	{
	    Console.WriteLine("videoInfo is an instance of the ZoomVideoInfo class");
	
	    // Show Zoom video info
	    Console.WriteLine("Title: {0}", videoInfo.Title);
	    Console.WriteLine("Description: {0}", videoInfo.Description);
	    Console.WriteLine("Duration: {0}", videoInfo.Duration);
	    Console.WriteLine("Thumbnails count: {0}", videoInfo.Thumbnails.Count);
	    Console.WriteLine("Formats count: {0}", videoInfo.Formats.Count);
	}

In the example above, we use the [MultimediaScraper()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimediascraper/constructors/main) constructor for creating an instance of the MultimediaScraper class (`scraper`) that can collect information from the specified page URL. The  [GetMultimedia(`url`)](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimediascraper/methods/getmultimedia) method initializes multimedia object by the specified URL. The [CollectVideoInfo()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimedia/methods/collectvideoinfo) method of the Multimedia class collects and provides video information from the URL. These can be the  [VideoInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/videoinfo) class properties such as Description, Duration, Formats, MultimediaHost, Thumbnails, and Title for a video file. 

You can get information about available video formats and download Zoom videos in different formats. For more information, please see the article [**How to Download a Video**](/html/net/web-scraping/video-download/).

{{% /alert %}}

The Aspose.HTML API includes a set of features for downloading video files. With this functionality, you can programmatically download videos through your own front end in your own application. You may download a video in different formats: in the best available quality or, for example, in low size when you are on a slow or intermittent connection. Using the  [VideoFormatInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/videoformatinfo) class, you can select a video format based on some criterion or criteria and specify the desired file extension.

To download a video file with Aspose.HTML, you should follow a few steps:
1. Initialize an instance of the [MultimediaScraper](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimediascraper) class.
2. Create a multimedia object.
3. Create a [VideoInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/videoinfo) object.
4. Select a format based on some criterion or criteria. 
5. Specify a video format and full file path for the output file.
6. Download Zoom video using the [Download()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimedia/methods/download) method.

Here is a C# example of how to download Zoom videos and get information about them:
{{< highlight java >}}
using Aspose.Html.DataScraping.MultimediaScraping;
using Aspose.Html.DataScraping.MultimediaScraping.Zoom;
using System.Linq;
using System.IO;
...	

    // URL of the video you want to extract data from
    string url = "https://zoom.us/recording/play/IMjKs3RC8-QaTcYQSFutPxB6CyrezT9pIqfsVj4nF8UIbyXbsvzMnLgjgP83cDHS";    
    
    // File name for downloading video
    string filename = "Session1";
    
    // Initialize an instance of the MultimediaScraper class
    using var multimediaScraper = new MultimediaScraper();
    
    // Create a multimedia object that collects information from the URL
    using var multimedia = multimediaScraper.GetMultimedia(url);
    
    // Get a VideoInfo object
    var videoInfo = multimedia.CollectVideoInfo();
    
    // Cast a videoInfo to ZoomVideoInfo type
    var ZoomVideoInfo = videoInfo as ZoomVideoInfo;
    
    if (ZoomVideoInfo != null)
    {
        // Get the first element from the formats collection with minimal bitrate
        var format = ZoomVideoInfo.Formats.OrderBy(f => f.Bitrate).First();
    
        // Get the extension for the output file
        var ext = string.IsNullOrEmpty(format.Extension) ? "mp4" : format.Extension;
    
        // Get the full file path for the output file
        var filePath = Path.Combine(OutputDir, filename + "." + ext);
    
        // Download Zoom video
        multimedia.Download(format, filePath);
    
        // Show Zoom video info
        Console.WriteLine("Title: {0}", ZoomVideoInfo.Title);
        Console.WriteLine("Description: {0}", ZoomVideoInfo.Description);
        Console.WriteLine("Duration: {0}", ZoomVideoInfo.Duration);
        Console.WriteLine("Thumbnails count: {0}", ZoomVideoInfo.Thumbnails.Count);
        Console.WriteLine("Formats count: {0}", ZoomVideoInfo.Formats.Count);               
    } 
{{< /highlight >}}

The [Download(`format`, `filePath`)](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimedia/methods/download) method of the [Multimedia](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimedia) class takes as parameters the information about the video file to download (it is a local VideoFormatInfo variable `format`) and a local path to the output file `filePath`; then, it downloads the video file to your local file system.

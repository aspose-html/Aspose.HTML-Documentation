## **Get YouKu Video Info**

Aspose.HTML for .NET API provides a powerful toolset to analyze and collect information from HTML documents and allows you to get info and download YouKu video by its URL. To obtain information about a video file, follow these steps:

1. Initialize an instance of the [MultimediaScraper](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimediascraper) class.
2. Create a multimedia object that collects information from the specified  URL.
3. Create a [VideoInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/videoinfo) object and check whether it is an instance of the [YouKuVideoInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping.youku/youkuvideoinfo) class.
4. Get information about the video and display it in the console.

The following code snippet can be used to get information about a video file such as Title, Description, Duration, Thumbnails, and Formats Count.
{{< highlight java >}}
using Aspose.Html.DataScraping.MultimediaScraping;
using Aspose.Html.DataScraping.MultimediaScraping.YouKu;
...

	// URL of the video you want to extract data from
	string url = "https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzgyODk3MDk0NA==.html?spm=a2h0c.8166622.PhoneSokuUgc_5.dscreenshot";
	
	// Initialize an instance of the MultimediaScraper class 
	using var multimediaScraper = new MultimediaScraper();
	
	// Create a multimedia object that collects information from the URL 
	using var multimedia = multimediaScraper.GetMultimedia(url);
	
	// Get a VideoInfo object
	var info = multimedia.CollectVideoInfo();
	
	if (info.MultimediaHost == MultimediaHost.YouKu)
	{
	    var youKuVideoInfo = (YouKuVideoInfo)info;
	
	    // Show YouKu video info
	    Console.WriteLine("Title: {0}", youKuVideoInfo.Title);
	    Console.WriteLine("Description: {0}", youKuVideoInfo.Description);
	    Console.WriteLine("Duration: {0}", youKuVideoInfo.Duration);
	    Console.WriteLine("Thumbnails count: {0}", youKuVideoInfo.Thumbnails.Count);
	    Console.WriteLine("Formats count: {0}", youKuVideoInfo.Formats.Count);        
	}

In the example above, we use the [GetMultimedia(`url`)](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimediascraper/methods/getmultimedia) method of MultimediaScraper class for initializing multimedia object that can receive information from the specified page URL. The [CollectVideoInfo()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimedia/methods/collectvideoinfo) method of the Multimedia class collects and provides video information from the associated URL. These can be the  [VideoInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/videoinfo) class properties such as Description, Duration, Formats, MultimediaHost, Thumbnails, and Title for a video file. 

You can get information about available video formats and download YouKu videos in different formats. For more information, please see the article [**How to Download a Video**](/html/net/web-scraping/video-download/).

{{% /alert %}}

The Aspose.HTML API includes a set of features for downloading video files. With this functionality, you can programmatically download videos through your own front end in your own application. You may download a video in different formats: in the best available quality or, for example, in low size when you are on a slow or intermittent connection. Using the  [VideoFormatInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/videoformatinfo) class, you can select a video format based on some criterion or criteria and specify the desired file extension.

To download a video file with Aspose.HTML, you should follow a few steps:
1. Initialize an instance of the [MultimediaScraper](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimediascraper) class.
2. Create a multimedia object.
3. Create a [VideoInfo](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/videoinfo) object.
4. Select a format based on some criterion or criteria. 
5. Specify a video format and full file path for the output file.
6. Download YouKu video using the [Download()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimedia/methods/download) method.

Here is a C# example of how to download YouKu videos and get information about them:
{{< highlight java >}}
using Aspose.Html.DataScraping.MultimediaScraping;
using Aspose.Html.DataScraping.MultimediaScraping.YouKu;
using System.Linq;
using System.IO;
...	

    // URL of the video you want to extract data from
    string url = "https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzgyODk3MDk0NA==.html?spm=a2h0c.8166622.PhoneSokuUgc_5.dscreenshot";
    
    // Expected video properties, for example, "Title" and "Duration" 
    string expectedTitle = "News 24";
    int expectedDuration = 59;
    
    // File name for downloading video
    string filename = "News-24";
    
    // Initialize an instance of the MultimediaScraper class
    using var multimediaScraper = new MultimediaScraper();
    
    // Create a multimedia object that collects information from the URL
    using var multimedia = multimediaScraper.GetMultimedia(url);
    
    // Get a VideoInfo object
    var videoInfo = multimedia.CollectVideoInfo();
    
    // Cast a videoInfo to YouKuVideoInfo type
    var youKuVideoInfo = videoInfo as YouKuVideoInfo;
    
    if (youKuVideoInfo != null)
    {
        // Get the first element from the formats collection with minimal bitrate
        var format = youKuVideoInfo.Formats.OrderBy(f => f.Bitrate).First();
    
        // Get the extension for the output file
        var ext = string.IsNullOrEmpty(format.Extension) ? "mp4" : format.Extension;
    
        // Get the full file path for the output file
        var filePath = Path.Combine(OutputDir, filename + "." + ext);
    
        // Download YouKu video
        multimedia.Download(format, filePath);
    
        // Show YouKu video info
        Console.WriteLine("Title: {0}", youKuVideoInfo.Title);
        Console.WriteLine("Description: {0}", youKuVideoInfo.Description);
        Console.WriteLine("Duration: {0}", youKuVideoInfo.Duration);
        Console.WriteLine("Thumbnails count: {0}", youKuVideoInfo.Thumbnails.Count);
        Console.WriteLine("Formats count: {0}", youKuVideoInfo.Formats.Count);               
    }

The [Download(`format`, `filePath`)](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.datascraping.multimediascraping/multimedia/methods/download) method of the Multimedia class takes as parameters the information about the video file to download (it is a local VideoFormatInfo variable `format`) and a local path to the output file `filePath`; then, it downloads the video file to your local file system.

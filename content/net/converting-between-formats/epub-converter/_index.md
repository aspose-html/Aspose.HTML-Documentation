The main highlight of Aspose.HTML is the conversion feature. EPUB is an open XML-based format for digital books and publications, which can be view and read on smartphones, tablets and computers. The [Aspose.Html.Converters](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters) namespace implements easy access to conversion methods. It provides a wide range of {{%EPUB %}} conversions to popular formats, such as {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%BMP%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, and {{%GIF%}}.

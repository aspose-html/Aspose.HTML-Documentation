Welcome to the "Converting between Formats" guides! The main highlight of Aspose.HTML is the conversion feature. Converting between formats is required for various reasons: to work in a familiar, convenient format or to take advantage of different formats for specific tasks. This chapter provides a general description of the conversion features  of Aspose.HTML .NET. In the article you find out how to convert HTML, MHTML, EPUB, Markdown and SVG files using .NET library.

## **A Few Ways to Convert files**

Aspose.HTML for .NET offers several ways to convert between formats: converting can perform by using methods of the [Converter](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/) class or the [RenderTo()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument/renderto/#renderto) method.

1. The static Converter class is a shared facade that provides HTML, MHTML, EPUB, Markdown and SVG file conversions to the popular formats and allows to make these operations convenient and easy. The static methods as an understandable and straightforward way to convert HTML, SVG, MHTML, EPUB, MD documents to PDF, XPS, DOCX, MD, MHTML and Image formats. 

2. The RenderTo() method is used to render HTML or SVG to another format and send a document to the output device. Aspose.HTML API provides the following output devices implementation: the PdfDevice, XpsDevice, DocDevise, and ImageDevice classes, which perform rendering to PDF, XPS, DOCX and Image file formats respectively.

The following example demonstrates converting HTML to PDF using  the [Converter](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/) class, with one line of code:

{{< highlight java >}}
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Html.Converters;
using Aspose.Html.Saving;
...
     // Invoke the ConvertHTML() method to convert the HTML code to PDF           
     Converter.ConvertHTML(@"<h1>Hello, World!</h1>", ".", new PdfSaveOptions(), Path.Combine(OutputDir, "convert-with-single-line.pdf"));
{{< /highlight >}}

In the example, we use the [ConvertHTML(`content, baseUri, options, outputPath`)](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) method of the Converter class. Despite the HTML to PDF conversion is required only one line of code, the following operations were performed:

1. Prepare code for an HTML document.
2. Create a new PdfSaveOptions object with default options. 
3. Use the ConvertHTML() method that takes as parameters `content`, `baseUri`, `options`, and `outputPath`. **Note:** You need to specify the path to the output file in your local file system (`outputPath`).

To convert HTML to PDF using the  [RenderTo()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument/renderto/#renderto) method, you can use the following code snippet:

{{< highlight java >}}
using Aspose.Html;
using Aspose.Html.Rendering.Pdf;
using System.IO;
...

    // Prepare path to a source HTML file
    string documentPath = Path.Combine(DataDir, "spring.html");
    
    // Prepare path for converted file saving 
    string savePath = Path.Combine(OutputDir, "spring-output.pdf");
    
    // Initialize an HTML document from the file
    using var document = new HTMLDocument(documentPath);
    
    // Create an instance of the PdfRenderingOptions class
    var pdfOptions = new PdfRenderingOptions();
    
    // Create the PDF Device and specify the output file to render
    using var device = new PdfDevice(pdfOptions, savePath);
    
    // Render HTML to PDF
    document.RenderTo(device);

In the [Fine-Tuning Converters](/html/net/converting-between-formats/fine-tuning-converters/) article, you will find more information on using different rendering options and parameters to customize the rendering result.

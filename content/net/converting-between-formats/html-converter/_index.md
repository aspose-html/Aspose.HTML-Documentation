The main highlight of Aspose.HTML is a conversion feature. Converting between formats is required for various reasons: to work in a familiar, convenient format or to take advantage of different formats for specific tasks. The [Aspose.Html.Converters](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters) namespace implements easy access to conversion methods. It provides a wide range of {{%HTML%}} conversions to popular formats, such as {{%PDF%}}, {{%XPS%}}, {{%DOCX%}}, {{%JPG%}}, {{%PNG%}}, {{%BMP%}}, {{%TIFF%}}, {{%GIF%}}, {{%MHTML%}},  and {{%MD%}}.

Any conversion you want to perform involves loading an HTML document and saving it in the supported format. It can be different scenarios, but it can be made with a few required steps:

1. Load an HTML document into a Document object using one of [HTMLDocument()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument) constructors. You can load HTML from a file, HTML code, stream, or URL.

2. Invoke one of the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/methods/converthtml/index) methods and pass the required parameters to it.

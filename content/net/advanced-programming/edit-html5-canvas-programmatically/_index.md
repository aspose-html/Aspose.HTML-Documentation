## **Canvas Rendering Context 2D**
Besides processing HTML5 Canvas as a part of an HTML document, you can work with canvas directly inside your C# code. Aspose.HTML provides [ICanvasRenderingContext2D](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/html/aspose.html.dom.canvas/icanvasrenderingcontext2d) interface for these operations, which is fully based on the official [standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#2dcontext). Following code snippet shows how to use the drawing feature of HTML5 Canvas to render a custom text filled in with the gradient brush.

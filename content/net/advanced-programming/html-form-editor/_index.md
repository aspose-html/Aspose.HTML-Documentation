The [HTML Form Element](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmlformelement/) represents a section containing input controls for submitting user information. Using our library, you can easily fulfill the HTML forms and send data directly from your C# application. To make this process is much more comfortable, we designed the [Aspose.Html.Forms](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.forms/) namespace. The main element of this namespace is [FormEditor](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.forms/formeditor/). It allows you to find an existing form in the document, create a new from scratch, iterate through the elements, fill them up with data and surely send the information to the remote server. In this article, you will learn how to work with [FormEditor](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.forms/formeditor/) object.
